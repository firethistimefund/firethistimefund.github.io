				<li><strong>We believe</strong> that artists, activists, and educators challenge perspectives and possess innovative ideas that ask critical questions about the world around us, both locally and globally.</li>
				<li><strong>We encourage</strong> leadership, voice and vision, among artists, activists and educators who may be new to the grant seeking process.</li>
				<li><strong>We prioritize</strong> the channeling of project-based funds to informal groups working in atypical ways, inside and outside of the non-profit model, without access or ties to extensive institutional support.</li>
				<li><strong>We encourage</strong> innovative, experimental and radical ideas and models of action.</li>
				<li><strong>We support</strong> creative cultural as well as creative, community organizing and education projects that provoke critical thought by raising awareness or dialogue around justice issues.</li>
				<li><strong>We value</strong> process, collaboration, goal-setting, reflection, community engagement, and open-endedness in the groups that we fund. </li>
				</ul>
